# claude-mods

[Claude Code](https://claude.dev/blog/getting-started-with-claude-code-mods/) mods by Eric Cologni.

> **Fork.** This is hnkabraham's fork of [augiefra/claude-mods](https://github.com/augiefra/claude-mods), branched from 3.9.6. It adds one block to token-weather-usage: the output speed in tokens per second. Everything else is upstream's.

## token-weather-usage

Stop hitting your Claude limit by surprise. One band above the prompt shows how big your context is, your 5-hour and weekly limits against the clock, whether the prompt cache is still warm, what the session and the last prompt cost, and which agents are running.

### Four situations

**All clear.** Small context, both limits behind the clock, the cache warm for almost an hour.

**Agents at work.** Three subagents running (hover the robot for their tasks); the 5-hour limit runs a little ahead of time, so its gauge turns yellow.

**Cache about to lapse.** Seven minutes left: send the next message now, or the whole 604k context gets written again at full price.

**Slow down.** Context near full, the 5-hour limit far ahead of time, the cache expired: `/compact` before going on.

### What each pill says

- **Context**: tokens in the context, with a weather icon from Clear to "Compact soon" (hover it for the share of the window). Then one bar per prompt for the last 8, as tall as the tokens it added, the current one in color, and the last prompt's change.
- **Speed** (fork): how fast the model wrote during the latest turn, in output tokens per second. Each request is timed from its first streamed chunk to its stop, so the wait before the response starts is left out and thinking counts; a turn's requests are summed. Subagents are not counted. Hover the stopwatch in the app for the tokens and seconds behind the figure.
- **5h / 7d**: the share of your account's limits already used. The gap with the time elapsed is hatched: grey after the bar while you have margin, in the bar's color when you use faster than time passes. Green while usage does not run ahead of time; yellow beyond; red when more than 15 points ahead or past 90%. Then the time left and, for the 5-hour limit, the reset time (machine's time zone). A window that already reset is hidden until the next reading; the latest reading is shared across the sessions open on the machine.
- **Cache**: the share of the last message read from the prompt cache, then the time before the cache lapses. Each message restarts the clock: 1 hour on a Claude subscription, 5 minutes on an API key. Mods get the token counts but not the lifetime, so it follows Claude Code's rules and corrects itself from what the traffic shows. Yellow under 10 minutes; "missed" with its cause (model changed, lapsed, start changed) when a message had to write the cache again; red "expired" once it lapsed, with `/compact` past 100k tokens of context.
- **Cost**: what the session cost, as `/cost` totals it, and what the last prompt added (its subagents included). On a subscription it is the API-price equivalent, not a bill, hence the "≈".
- **Agents**: shown only while subagents run; hover the robot for the type and task of each. Background shell commands are not counted (Claude Code does not expose them to mods).

In the desktop app each block is a tinted pill with its icon. Fork: when the pills would not fit on one row, the band turns compact (the reset clocks, the trend, the word "cache" and the last prompt's cost move into the icons' and gauges' tooltips, and the gauges get shorter), then tight (no turn bars, no 5-hour time left, no coin); only past that do the pills wrap onto a second row. In the terminal the same blocks sit on one line, split by a thin rule:

```
☂ 634k ▃▆▂█▃▄▂▆ ▲ +6.3k │ 97 tok/s │ 5h ━━━━━━╍─ 74% · 24 min → 18:20 │ 7d ━━━━━─── 65% · 2d20h │ cache 98% · 52 min │ ≈ $41.07 (+$0.58) │ 2 agents
```

When the line does not fit the terminal, the bars, details and cost drop out, leaving labels and percentages.

### Language

Labels are in English or French. By default (`auto`) the mod follows `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES` or `LANG` and falls back to English. The desktop app often sets none of them: pick `en` or `fr` in the plugin's **Language** option in `/config`.

### Install

```
/plugin marketplace add augiefra/claude-mods
/plugin install token-weather-usage@augiefra-mods
/reload-plugins
```

This fork, from a local clone:

```
claude plugin marketplace add ~/Developer/claude-mods
claude plugin install token-weather-usage@hnkabraham-mods
```

If the line does not show up, restart Claude Code. A mod is code that runs inside Claude Code with the same access as Claude Code: read it before installing. This one is a single file, [token-weather-usage.mjs](plugins/token-weather-usage/hooks/token-weather-usage.mjs).

### Check

```
claude plugin validate ./plugins/token-weather-usage
claude plugin test ./plugins/token-weather-usage
```

## Privacy

token-weather-usage collects, sends and retains no personal data. It only reads the usage figures Claude Code provides (context fill, 5-hour and 7-day limits, session cost, each request's cache token counts), the list of the session's subagents, the locale variables above and the prompt-cache switches (`DISABLE_PROMPT_CACHING`, `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M`, `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT_CACHE_TTL`, `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H`). It keeps in the plugin's local storage, on the machine, the latest limits reading and, per session, recent context readings, the last request's cache figures, the last prompt's cost and the latest turn's output speed (deleted after 8 idle days). No network requests.

## Credits

- The context weather, the tokens and the turns chart come from Anthropic's **Token Weather** example ([claude-code-playground](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-playground), Apache-2.0).
- The limit gauges are inspired by HolyGrail's **usage-meter** ([HolyGrail/claude-mods](https://github.com/HolyGrail/claude-mods/tree/main/plugins/usage-meter)). They were written for this mod after usage-meter (same idea: gauges with an elapsed-time marker, a reading shared across sessions), without copying its code.
- The cache block is inspired by Daniel San's **prompt-cache-control** ([davila7/claude-code-templates](https://github.com/davila7/claude-code-templates), MIT). It was written for this mod after it (same idea: cache usage per request, an inferred lifetime, a countdown), without copying its code.
