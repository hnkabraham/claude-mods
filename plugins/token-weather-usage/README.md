# Token Weather Usage

One band above the Claude Code prompt: the context in tokens, your 5-hour and 7-day limits against the clock, whether the prompt cache is still warm, what the session and the last prompt cost, and which agents are running.

- **Context**: tokens in the context with a weather icon (hover it for the share of the window), one bar per recent prompt, the last prompt's change.
- **Speed** (fork): output tokens per second over the latest turn, timed from each request's first streamed chunk to its stop. Main loop only.
- **5h / 7d**: the share of your account's limits already used, in green, yellow or red by pace. The gap with the time elapsed is hatched: grey while you have margin, in the bar's color when you use faster than time passes. Then the time left and the reset time (machine's time zone).
- **Cache**: the share of the last message read from the prompt cache and the time before it lapses (1 hour on a subscription, 5 minutes on an API key, inferred). Yellow under 10 minutes, "missed" with its cause, red "expired" with `/compact` on a large context.
- **Cost**: the session cost as `/cost` totals it, and what the last prompt added. On a subscription, an API-price equivalent, not a bill.
- **Agents**: shown while subagents run; hover the robot for their tasks.

Labels in English or French: `auto` follows `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES` or `LANG`, otherwise pick `en` or `fr` in the **Language** option (`/config`).

## Privacy

No personal data collected, sent or retained, no network requests. The mod reads the usage figures Claude Code provides (context, limits, session cost, each request's cache token counts), the list of the session's subagents, the locale variables and the prompt-cache switches, and keeps in the plugin's local storage the latest limits reading and, per session, recent context readings, the last request's cache figures and the last prompt's cost (deleted after 8 idle days).
